ApolloSBMDevelopments - ApolloSkyblockMod

Support - ApolloSBMDevelopments@gmail.com

Welcome to our GitHub page, we're working on a new mod called ApolloSkyblockMod, we're mainly going to be focused on adding more QoL to the game much like mods like Skytils, NEU, and SBA, but we hope to improve on all of their features and add more.

Why  is this useful? Many newer players have to go through the hassle of having to find a bunch of QoL mods or mods to help them do things, but we are just going to combine the features of all those mods and improve on them as much as we can so you don't have to go through the hassle of installing many different mods and only have to get one.

Bannable? No, this mod is very similar to other mods that I mentioned before and they clearly aren't bannable, if you have any further questions about the mod, just send an email to the support email. (MUCH LIKE OTHER MODS, USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK)

All the hotkeys are configurable in the mod menu

The only command you need to pull up the mod is /ASBM or /ApolloSBM
